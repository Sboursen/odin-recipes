            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                Chicken cooked in a tagine is always meltingly tender. Adding sweet, caramelized pears at the end makes this Moroccan dish irresistible.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>7 tablespoons olive oil, divided </li>
                <li>2 onions, peeled and sliced </li>
                <li>1 whole chicken, cut into pieces </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fresh ginger root, peeled and minced  </li>
                <li>Â½ cup water</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Heat 2 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook onions until softened and browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer onions into a tagine. Layer chicken pieces on top of onions.</p></li>
                <li><p>Combine turmeric, cumin, ground coriander, and salt in a small bowl; mix well with remaining 5 tablespoons olive oil. Spread spice mixture onto the chicken pieces. Add cinnamon pieces, bay leaves, ginger, and cilantro. Pour in 1/2 cup of water and cover tagine with a lid.</p></li>
                <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p></li>
                <li><p>Melt butter in a skillet over low heat while chicken is cooking. Add sliced pears and honey and cook, while stirring, until honey has caramelized.</p></li>
